  It features projects and ideas that are definitely outside the box. Let's expand the boundaries of what's possible,
  unlocking unknown knowledge ‚Äî just like we did in the past editions when we learned
  <a data-l10n-name='link-talk-water'>how to build computers using only water</a> and
  <a data-l10n-name='link-talk-satellite'>how to do reverse engineering in the satellite communication</a>!
row-what-is-gambiconf--body-paragraph-3 =
  This is a multilingual, not limited to a specific technology, conference. We try to focus more on the purpose
  of the presented projects, the unique nature of the sessions, and what one can learn from a random, very unusual,
  idea. We want to encourage people to try new ideas and discover new things, for the simple sake of curiosity
  and exploration.

  Based on conferences like <a data-l10n-name='link-bangbangcon'>!!Con</a> and <a data-l10n-name='link-sigbovik'>SIGBOVIK</a>,
  we organized the first online edition in <a data-l10n-name='link-gambiconf-2021'>2021</a>, the second one in
  <a data-l10n-name='link-gambiconf-2022'>2022</a>, in Portugal, and this year we are in-person in Brazil!
