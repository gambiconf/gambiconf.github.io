  It features projects and ideas that are definitely outside the box. Let's expand the boundaries of what's possible,
  unlocking unknown knowledge — just like we did in the past editions when we learned
  <a data-l10n-name='link-talk-water'>how to build computers using only water</a> and
  <a data-l10n-name='link-talk-satellite'>how to do reverse engineering in the satellite communication</a>!
row-what-is-gambiconf--body-paragraph-3 =
  This is a multilingual, not limited to a specific technology, conference. We try to focus more on the purpose
  of the presented projects, the unique nature of the sessions, and what one can learn from a random, very unusual,
  idea. We want to encourage people to try new ideas and discover new things, for the simple sake of curiosity
  and exploration.

  Based on conferences like <a data-l10n-name='link-bangbangcon'>!!Con</a> and <a data-l10n-name='link-sigbovik'>SIGBOVIK</a>,

  <a data-l10n-name='link-gambiconf-2022'>2022</a>, in Portugal, and this year we are in-person in Brazil!
